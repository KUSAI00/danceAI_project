**[0-10 seconds] Entrance & Initial Awareness**

*   **0-5s:** Music begins with a soft, ambient hum. **Dancer 1 (D1)** enters slowly from **upstage left**, head bowed, arms gently curved in front of their chest. They walk with weighted, deliberate steps to **upstage center**, then slowly raise their head, eyes scanning the space with a sense of quiet searching.
*   **5-10s:** **Dancer 2 (D2)** enters from **upstage right**, mirroring D1's slow, deliberate walk but with a slightly more open posture, arms reaching subtly forward. They stop at **downstage right**, turning to face upstage left, a faint inclination towards D1. **Dancer 3 (D3)** enters from **downstage left**, with a fluid, almost swaying motion, hands tracing the contours of their own body. They stop at **downstage left**, facing the audience, a sense of quiet introspection. All three are now distinct points on stage, subtly aware of each other's presence.

**[10-25 seconds] Awakening & Hesitant Connection**

*   **10-15s:** Music introduces a gentle, pulsing rhythm. D1 slowly lifts their arms, reaching upwards and outwards, like unfurling wings, a gesture of expansion. Their gaze sweeps across the stage.
*   **15-20s:** D2 performs a deep, grounded plié, extending one arm towards D1 in a tentative reach, then slowly retracting it, a gesture of hesitant connection. Their eyes briefly meet D1's.
*   **20-25s:** D3 initiates a fluid spinal roll, rising from a low crouch to a full stand, mirroring D1's arm extension but with a more grounded, internal focus. They finish facing **downstage center**, their gaze finally lifting to acknowledge the space.

**[25-45 seconds] Mirroring & Converging**

*   **25-30s:** The music gains a clearer, more driving beat. D1 initiates a sequence: a lean to the left, a ripple through their torso, arms sweeping down and then up in a graceful arc.
*   **30-35s:** D2 and D3 begin to subtly mirror D1's movements. D2 performs the ripple a beat behind, slightly more angular. D3 performs it with more fluidity and expansiveness, facing **upstage right**.
*   **35-40s:** All three dancers begin to move towards **center stage**. D1 takes a few gliding steps downstage. D2 pivots and walks towards center. D3 executes a slow turn as they move towards center. They form a loose, open triangle around **center stage**.
*   **40-45s:** They perform a synchronized, flowing sequence: a collective intake of breath, a shared arm sweep that begins low and rises high, followed by a gentle weight shift from side to side. Their eyes occasionally meet, acknowledging the growing connection.

**[45-70 seconds] Unison & Release**

*   **45-55s:** The music swells to a powerful, melodic peak. The dancers converge into a tighter formation at **center stage**, D1 slightly forward, D2 and D3 on either side, slightly behind. They execute a strong unison phrase: a dramatic lunge forward (D1 leading the direction), followed by a powerful collective upward reach, then a release into a low, grounded turn, their bodies spiraling together.
*   **55-65s:** They momentarily break apart, dispersing with controlled energy. D1 moves to **upstage left**, performing a sustained, expressive backbend. D2 moves to **downstage right**, executing a sharp, quick spin followed by a grounded balance. D3 moves to **downstage left**, performing a deep, yearning reach into the empty space. Each phrase is short, reflecting their individual interpretations of the collective energy.
*   **65-70s:** They quickly re-converge at **center stage**, their movements becoming more intertwined and tactile. Hands brush, D2 briefly supports D1's lean, D3 connects with D2's arm in a moment of shared balance. A brief, powerful moment of physical connection.

**[70-85 seconds] Dissipation & Exit**

*   **70-75s:** The music begins to fade, returning to its initial atmospheric quality. The dancers gradually loosen their physical connection, movements becoming softer and more internal.
*   **75-80s:** D1 slowly retreats to **upstage center**, their movements dissolving into a gentle, internal sway, eventually settling into a kneeling position, head tilted upwards as if listening to a distant echo.
*   **80-85s:** D2 slowly backs away towards **downstage right**, their movements melting towards the floor, eventually curling into a gentle, fetal-like position. D3 performs a final, slow, reaching gesture towards the empty space where the others were, then turns and slowly walks off **upstage right**, disappearing as the music fades to complete silence. D1 and D2 hold their final, still positions as the lights dim.
