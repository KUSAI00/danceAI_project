---

### **0:00 – 0:15 | The Awakening (Intro)**
*   **0:00 – 0:05:** Stage is empty. **Dancer A** enters from **Up-Center**, walking slowly backward toward **Center Stage**. Their posture is slumped, head down.
*   **0:05 – 0:10:** **Dancer B** enters from **Down-Left** and **Dancer C** from **Down-Right**. They move quickly, almost running, to meet **Dancer A** in the center. They stop abruptly on either side of A, facing inward.
*   **0:10 – 0:15:** In silence (or minimal sound), B and C place a hand on A’s shoulder. **Dancer A** suddenly inhales sharply, snapping their head up to look at the audience. B and C recoil/jump back to the edges of the center spotlight.

### **0:15 – 0:30 | Liquid Motion (Verse)**
*   **0:15 – 0:20:** All three dancers drop into a deep second-position plié (wide squat). In unison, they perform a fluid body roll starting from the hips up to the head, arms floating upward like smoke.
*   **0:20 – 0:25:** **Dancer A** (Center) drops to the floor and rolls toward **Stage Left**. Simultaneously, **Dancer B** (Stage Left) leaps over A toward **Stage Right**. **Dancer C** (Stage Right) slides backward to **Up-Right**.
*   **0:25 – 0:30:** The dancers form a diagonal line from **Up-Right** to **Down-Left**. They perform a canon (ripple effect) movement: Right arm slices across the chest, followed by a sharp head turn to the left. Order: C, then A, then B.

### **0:30 – 0:50 | The Pulse (Chorus/High Energy)**
*   **0:30 – 0:35:** The music kicks in. The diagonal line breaks. **Dancer A** runs to **Down-Center**. **B and C** stay **Upstage**.
*   **0:35 – 0:40:** Unison phrase: Kick right leg forward, step back, turn over the left shoulder, and land in a lunge facing **Stage Right**. Sharp arm movements (tutting) for 2 seconds.
*   **0:40 – 0:45:** **Dancer A** performs a floor sequence (coffee grinder/sweep into a push-up). **Dancers B and C** perform high jumps (stag leaps) crossing each other—B moves to **Stage Right**, C moves to **Stage Left**.
*   **0:45 – 0:50:** All three converge at **Center Stage** again. They stand back-to-back forming a tight triangle. They jump in place, turning the triangle slightly with each bounce, syncing with the beat.

### **0:50 – 0:70 | Tension (Bridge)**
*   **0:50 – 0:55:** The triangle explodes outward. **Dancer A** falls forward but is caught by **Dancer B**. **Dancer C** circles them anxiously.
*   **0:55 – 0:60:** **Dancer B** pushes A back to a standing position. **Dancer C** grabs A’s hand and spins them toward **Up-Left**.
*   **0:60 – 0:65:** **Dancer B** and **Dancer C** engage in a "mirroring" duet at **Down-Right**, moving hands palm-to-palm without touching. **Dancer A** watches them from **Up-Left**, performing slow, agonizing reaches toward them.
*   **0:65 – 0:70:** **Dancer A** runs and slides on their knees between B and C, breaking their connection. All three freeze, looking at different corners of the room.

### **0:70 – 0:85 | The Fade (Outro)**
*   **0:70 – 0:75:** The music slows. Each dancer slowly stands up.
*   **0:75 – 0:80:** **Dancer B** backs away into the shadows of **Up-Left**. **Dancer C** backs away to **Up-Right**.
*   **0:80 – 0:85:** **Dancer A** is left alone at **Center Stage**. They repeat the opening movement: slumping shoulders, head dropping down. They slowly walk backward toward **Up-Center**, fading into the darkness as the lights dim.

**Total Time:** Approx. 85 Seconds.
