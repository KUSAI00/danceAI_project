---

### **0:00 – 0:10: The Awakening**
*   **0:00 – 0:05:** The stage is dark. A spotlight hits **Center Stage**. **Dancer A** is curled in a tight ball on the floor.
*   **0:05 – 0:10:** **Dancer A** slowly unfolds, extending the right arm upward as if reaching for light, followed by the left leg extending along the floor. They rise to a kneeling position, head rolling loosely to the back.

### **0:10 – 0:20: The Convergence**
*   **0:10 – 0:15:** **Dancer B** enters from **Up-Left** and **Dancer C** enters from **Up-Right**. They move quickly but silently, performing low runs with knees bent.
*   **0:15 – 0:20:** B and C arrive at **Center Stage** flanking Dancer A. They place a hand on Dancer A’s shoulders. Dancer A contracts sharply (pulling stomach in), causing B and C to recoil and spin away to **Down-Left** and **Down-Right** respectively.

### **0:20 – 0:35: The Pulse (Unison)**
*   **0:20 – 0:25:** The beat drops. All three dancers stand up abruptly. They face the audience in a triangle formation (**A** at the back/Up-Center, **B** and **C** downstage).
*   **0:25 – 0:30:** **Unison Movement:** All three step wide to the right, sweeping arms low across the floor. They pull up into a high arch, arms in a 'V' shape. They drop into a deep squat, head down.
*   **0:30 – 0:35:** Explosive jump (star jump) landing softly. They perform a double turn (pirouette) to the left, ending with a sudden stop, facing **Stage Right**.

### **0:35 – 0:50: The Ripple (Canon)**
*   **0:35 – 0:40:** **Dancer B** (Down-Left) initiates a movement: a high leg kick followed by a fall to the floor.
*   **0:40 – 0:45:** Two seconds later, **Dancer C** (Down-Right) repeats the exact same movement. Two seconds after that, **Dancer A** (Up-Center) repeats it.
*   **0:45 – 0:50:** All three are now on the floor. They roll toward **Center Stage**, tangling their limbs slightly to create a connected, sculptural pile of bodies.

### **0:50 – 1:05: The Climax**
*   **0:50 – 0:55:** They break apart. **Dancer A** runs to **Down-Center** and performs a large leap (grand jeté). **Dancer B** and **C** run to the back wall (**Upstage**).
*   **0:55 – 1:00:** **Dancer A** performs a frantic solo of rapid arm gestures and spins at **Down-Center**. Meanwhile, **B** and **C** run forward from the back, sliding on their knees to meet A.
*   **1:00 – 1:05:** **B** and **C** lift **Dancer A** high into the air. A holds a stiff, plank-like position horizontally above their heads. They rotate the lift slowly once.

### **1:05 – 1:20: The Ebb**
*   **1:05 – 1:10:** **B** and **C** gently lower **A** to the ground. The music begins to fade.
*   **1:10 – 1:15:** **Dancer B** walks slowly backward to **Stage Left**, looking at the others. **Dancer C** walks backward to **Stage Right**. **Dancer A** remains standing **Center**.
*   **1:15 – 1:20:** **B** and **C** turn their backs to the audience and freeze. **Dancer A** begins to tremble slightly, repeating the reaching hand motion from the very beginning.

### **1:20 – 1:30: Final Resolve**
*   **1:20 – 1:25:** **Dancer A** slowly lowers the hand and looks directly at the audience.
*   **1:25 – 1:30:** **Dancer A** takes one step back into the darkness as the lights fade to black.

**Total Time:** 90 Seconds.
