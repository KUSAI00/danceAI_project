### **0:00 – 0:10: The Awakening (Entrances)**
*   **Stage Setup:** The stage is empty.
*   **0:00–0:05:** **Dancer A** begins already on stage, lying curled in a fetal position at **Center Stage**.
*   **0:05–0:10:** **Dancer B** enters from **Up-Left** and **Dancer C** enters from **Up-Right**. They walk slowly, almost dragging their feet, moving toward Dancer A. Their gaze is fixed intently on Dancer A.

### **0:10 – 0:20: Connection**
*   **0:10–0:15:** B and C arrive at Center. They slowly kneel beside A. B places a hand on A’s shoulder; C places a hand on A’s back.
*   **0:15–0:20:** As if magnetized by their touch, **Dancer A** slowly unfolds, rising first to their knees, then standing. B and C rise with them. The movement is fluid, like moving through water. They end standing in a tight triangle formation, facing the audience.

### **0:20 – 0:35: Unison Flow (Building Energy)**
*   **0:20–0:25:** All three dancers perform in unison. They lunge deeply to the **Right**, sweeping their right arms low across the floor. They recover to center, arching their backs and reaching both arms high toward the ceiling (a high release).
*   **0:25–0:30:** A sharp exhale/drop. They contract their torsos, pulling elbows in tight to their ribs. Immediately, they spin (pirouette) once to the left.
*   **0:30–0:35:** They run three steps forward to **Down-Stage Center**. They stop abruptly, extending their right legs to the side and holding a balance for two seconds.

### **0:35 – 0:50: The Ripple (Canon)**
*   **0:35–0:40:** **Dancer A** (center of the trio) drops to the floor and rolls backward toward **Up-Center**.
*   **0:40–0:45:** **Dancer B** reaches toward where A was, then turns sharply and runs to **Stage Left**. **Dancer C** mirrors this, reaching and then running to **Stage Right**.
*   **0:45–0:50:** **Dancer A** stands up at Up-Center and performs a solo: A high leap (grand jeté) forward, followed by a frantic turning sequence, arms flailing slightly to suggest struggle. B and C stand still on the sides, watching A.

### **0:50 – 0:65: Convergence and Lift**
*   **0:50–0:55:** B and C rush inward from the sides to meet A at **Center Stage**.
*   **0:55–0:60:** **The Lift:** A jumps straight up. B and C catch A by the waist and thighs, lifting A high above their heads. A arches their back, looking at the ceiling, arms spread wide in a "V" shape.
*   **0:60–0:65:** B and C slowly lower A to the ground. As A’s feet touch the floor, all three dancers crouch low, hands touching the floor.

### **0:65 – 0:80: The Release (High Energy)**
*   **0:65–0:70:** Explosion of energy. They break formation.
    *   **Dancer A** runs to **Down-Right**.
    *   **Dancer B** runs to **Up-Left**.
    *   **Dancer C** runs to **Down-Left**.
*   **0:70–0:75:** Each dancer performs a "chaîné" turn (rapid traveling turns) toward **Center Stage**.
*   **0:75–0:80:** They meet in the middle but do not stop; they pass through each other, switching spots, and end up with their backs to the audience, looking at the back wall (Up-Stage).

### **0:80 – 0:90: Resolution**
*   **0:80–0:85:** They slowly turn their heads to look over their right shoulders at the audience.
*   **0:85–0:90:** Simultaneously, they raise one hand toward the sky, then slowly lower it as they sink to their knees.
*   **Final Pose:** All three kneeling, backs to the audience, heads bowed down. Lights fade to black.
