---

### **0:00–0:15: The Awakening (Isolation)**

*   **0:00:** The stage is dark. Lights fade up on a diagonal line.
    *   **D1** is Upstage Left (back corner).
    *   **D2** is Center Stage.
    *   **D3** is Downstage Right (front corner).
    *   *Pose:* All three stand with feet wide apart, heads bowed, arms hanging loosely.
*   **0:05:** On a sharp beat, **D3** snaps their head up to look at the audience.
*   **0:07:** **D2** sharply lifts their right arm to a 90-degree angle (robot-like).
*   **0:10:** **D1** inhales audibly and contracts their chest inward.
*   **0:10–0:15:** A ripple canon occurs. Starting from D3 (front) to D1 (back), the dancers perform a sharp "tick-tock" isolation: Head tilts right, left, then the body drops into a low squat.

### **0:15–0:30: The Mechanism (Connection)**

*   **0:15:** The music introduces a driving beat. All dancers slide from their squat positions toward **Center Stage**, seemingly pulled by a magnetic force.
*   **0:20:** They meet in the center. They stand back-to-back in a tight triangle.
*   **0:22:** They interlock arms. As a unit, they slowly rotate the triangle clockwise. As they rotate, they lean outward, using each other's weight for balance.
*   **0:27:** The rotation speeds up. On a cymbal crash, they break the connection, spinning away from the center to three separate points:
    *   **D1** to Stage Right.
    *   **D2** to Upstage Center.
    *   **D3** to Stage Left.

### **0:30–0:50: The Fluidity (Expansion)**

*   **0:30:** The music becomes melodic. The robotic movements stop.
*   **0:32:** **D2** (Upstage) runs forward and performs a grand jeté (leap) toward Downstage, landing in a deep lunge and rolling on the floor to stand up facing back.
*   **0:38:** Simultaneously, **D1** and **D3** perform a mirroring duet on the sides. They sweep their legs in a high fan kick, then turn inward toward the center.
*   **0:42:** All three dancers converge in a horizontal line at **Downstage Center**.
*   **0:45:** Unison phrase: They reach high with both hands, arch their backs, then sweep the floor with their hands, recovering into a double pirouette (turn).

### **0:50–0:70: The Chaos (Interweaving)**

*   **0:50:** The formation breaks. **D1** runs Upstage Left, **D3** runs Upstage Right. **D2** remains Downstage.
*   **0:55:** **D1** and **D3** run diagonally across the stage, crossing paths in the center behind D2. They leap as they cross.
*   **1:00:** **D2** performs rapid, sharp hand gestures (tutting) while slowly walking backward toward Upstage.
*   **1:05:** **D1** and **D3** catch **D2** at Upstage Center. They lift **D2** horizontally above their heads. D2 holds a stiff, plank-like position.
*   **1:10:** They lower D2 slowly. All three end up on the floor, Upstage Center.

### **0:70–0:85: The Reset (Syncopation)**

*   **1:10:** From the floor, they roll forward toward Downstage in a canon (D1, then D2, then D3).
*   **1:15:** They stand up abruptly at **Downstage Left**.
*   **1:18:** Fast unison footwork: Stomp right, stomp left, slide back, jump together.
*   **1:22:** They look at each other, then look at their "imaginary watches" on their wrists.

### **0:85–0:90: The Power Down**

*   **1:25:** The music begins to distort and fade.
*   **1:27:** **D1** freezes mid-step, looking Stage Right.
*   **1:28:** **D2** freezes with a hand over their mouth, looking Stage Left.
*   **1:29:** **D3** slowly collapses to the floor, curling into a ball.
*   **1:30:** Blackout on the final silence.
